Repo for my (currently unfinished) DPhil thesis.  I have made it public to allow comments, pull requests, etc before final submission (2nd Oct).  Various bits still need cleaning up (in particular some editing passes) and Chapters 9 onwards at yet to be properly smoothed in from the original papers.  However, it should still be a coherent readable article at this point.  I am particularly keen to hear anything people think is missing or any sections which are difficult to understand.
