\section{Basic Inference Algorithms for Universal Programs}
\label{sec:proginf:inf}

We start our introduction to some basic general purpose inference algorithms for
universal PPLs by linking our Anglican compilation back to our execution-based 
definition of the conditional distribution specified by a program given in 
Section~\ref{sec:probprog:models:general} and consider what classes of inference
algorithms might be able to operate in such settings.
