\chapter{Interacting Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:ipmcmc}

In this section we introduce \emph{interacting particle Markov chain Monte Carlo} (\ipmcmc), a \pmcmc method based on an interacting pool of standard and conditional sequential Monte Carlo samplers. Like related methods, \ipmcmc is a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler on an extended space. We present empirical results that show significant improvements in mixing rates relative to both non-interacting \pmcmc samplers, and a single \pmcmc sampler with an equivalent memory and computational budget. 
An additional advantage of the \ipmcmc method is that it is suitable for distributed and multi-core architectures.
