\section{Empirical Verification}
\label{sec:empirical}

The convergence rates proven in Section~\ref{sec:convergence} are only
\emph{upper bounds} on the worst-case performance we can expect. We will now
examine whether these convergence rates are tight in practice, investigate what happens
when our guidelines are not followed, and examine the effect of different strategies for
choosing $N_k$ under a sample budget.  We note that one of the main applications of
our results is provided later in Chapter~\ref{chp:design}, while an additional real-world
example is given in~\citep{rainforth2017pitfalls}.


\subsection{Simple Analytic Model}
\label{sec:simple}

We start with the following simple analytically calculable problem
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:model}
& y \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(-1,1), &&
z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), \\
& \phi(y,z) = \sqrt{2/\pi}\exp\left(-2(y-z)^2\right), &&
f(y,\gamma(y)) = \log (\gamma (y)) = \log(\E_z[\phi(y,z)]).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for which $I = \mathbb{E}_{p(y)}\left[f\left(y,\mathbb{E}_{p(z|y)}
\left[\phi(y,z)\right]\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left(\log(2)-\log(5)-\log(\pi)\right)-\frac{2}{15}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:emprical-conv} shows the corresponding empirical convergence obtained by
applying~\eqref{eq:nested-mc} to~\eqref{eq:model} directly. It shows that for this
problem the theoretical convergence rates from Theorem~\ref{the:Repeat} are indeed
realized.\footnote{Note the continuous differentiability assumption is satisfied as $\gamma(y)\neq0$
or $\infty$ for any $y\in[-1,1]$.}
The figure also demonstrates the danger of not increasing
$M$ with $N$, showing that the NMC estimator converges to an incorrect solution when $M$
is held constant.  Figure~\ref{fig:tau_sweep} shows the effect of varying $N$ and $M$ for various
fixed sample budgets $T$ and demonstrates that the asymptotically optimal strategy can be suboptimal
for finite budgets.

		The fixed $M$ case converges at the \mc error rate, but to a biased solution.
		Shown right is the final error for different total sample budgets
		as a function of $\alpha$ where $N=T^{\alpha}$ and $M=T^{1-\alpha}$ iterations are used for the outer
		and inner estimators respectively.  This shows that even though $\alpha=2/3$ is the
		asymptotically optimal allocation strategy, this is not the optimal solution for
		finite $T$. Nonetheless, as $T$ increases, the optimum value of $\alpha$ increases,
		starting at around $0.5$ for $T=10^3$ and reaching around $0.6$ for $T=10^7$. \vspace{-5pt}}

%\subsection{Planning Cancer Treatment}
%\label{sec:cancer}
%
%We now introduce a real-world example to show the applicability of NMC in a scenario
%where the solution is not analytically tractable and conventional \mc is insufficient.
%Consider a treatment center assessing a new policy for planning cancer treatments, subject to a budget. 
%Clinicians must decide on a patient-by-patient basis whether to administer chemotherapy in the
%hope that their tumor will reduce in size sufficiently to be able to perform surgery at a later date.
%A treatment is considered to have been successful if the size of the tumor drops below a threshold value in a fixed time window.
%The clinicians have at their disposal a simulator for the evolution of tumors with time,
%parameterized by both observable values, $y$, such as tumor size, and unobservable values, $z$, such as the patient-specific response to treatment.
%Given a set of input parameters, the simulator deterministically returns a binary response $\phi(y,z)\in\left\lbrace 0,1\right\rbrace $, with $\phi(y,z) = 1$ indicating a successful treatment.
%To estimate the probability of a successful treatment for a given patient, the clinician must calculate the expected
%success over these unobserved variables, namely $\E_{p(z|y)} [\phi(y,z)]$ where $p(z|y)$ represents a probabilistic
%model for the unobserved variables, which could, for example, be constructed based on empirical data.
%The clinician then decides whether to go ahead with the treatment for that
%patient based on whether the calculated probability of success exceeds a certain threshold $T_{\mathrm{treat}}$.
%
%\begin{figure}[t]
%	\centering
%		\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth,trim={1.5cm 0 3.5cm 0},clip]{canver_conv2}
%	\caption{Convergence of NMC for cancer simulation.
%		A ground truth estimate was calculated
%		using a single run with $M=10^5$ and $N=10^5$.
%		Results are averaged over 1000 independent runs, while shaded regions give the 25\%-75\% quantiles. We
%		see that the theoretical convergence rates are observed in all cases.
%		When $M=\sqrt{N}$ an interesting fluctuation behavior is observed.  
%		Further testing suggests that this originates because the bias of the estimator depends in
%		a fluctuating manner on the value of $M$ as the binary output of $\phi(y,z)$ creates a quantization
%		effect on the possible estimates for $\hat{\gamma}$.  This effect is also observed for the $M=N$ case,
%		but is less pronounced. \label{fig:emperical-conv-cancer} \vspace{-5pt}}
%\end{figure}
%
%The treatment center now wishes to estimate the expected number of patients that will be treated for a given $T_{\mathrm{treat}}$ so that it can minimize this threshold without exceeding its budget.
%To do this, it needs to calculate the expectation of the clinician's decisions to administer 
%treatment, giving the complete nested expectation for calculating the number of treated patients as
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:cancer}
%I(T_{\mathrm{treat}}) = \E_{p(y)} \left[\mathbb{I}\left(\E_{p(z|y)} [\phi(y,z)]>T_{\mathrm{treat}}\right)\right],
%\end{equation}
%where the identity function $\mathbb{I}(\cdot > T_{\mathrm{treat}})$ imposes a non-linear
%mapping, such that conventional Monte Carlo estimation is not possible. Full details on $\phi$, $p(y)$, and $p(z|y)$ are 
%provided in~\cite{rainforth2017pitfalls}.
%
%To verify the convergence rate, we repeat the analysis from Section~\ref{sec:simple} for the problem defined 
%by~\eqref{eq:cancer} at a fixed value of $T_{\mathrm{treat}}=0.35$. 
%The results, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:emperical-conv-cancer}, again verify the theoretical rates. 
%By further testing different values of $T_{\mathrm{treat}}$, we found $T_{\mathrm{treat}} \ge 0.125$ (i.e.
%go ahead with treatment if the probability of success is 0.125 or greater) to be the optimal under the budget.
