\chapter{Nested Estimation}
\label{chp:nest}

We present a formalization of nested Monte Carlo (NMC) estimation, whereby
terms in an outer estimator are themselves the output of separate, nested, Monte Carlo (MC) estimators.
We demonstrate that NMC can provide consistent estimates of 
nested expectations under mild conditions, 
establish corresponding rates of convergence, 
and provide empirical evidence that suggests these rates are observed in practice.
We further establish a number of pitfalls that can arise from na\"{i}ve nesting of MC estimators
and provide guidelines about how they can be avoided.
Finally, we derive a new estimator for use in discrete Bayesian 
experimental design problems, which has a better convergence rate than 
existing methods.
