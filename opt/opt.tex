\chapter{A Predominantly Bayesian Approach to Optimization}
\label{chp:opt}

From designing engineering components to managing portfolios and tuning control systems,
optimization is used ubiquitously throughout engineering and the sciences.   Whereas inference
dealt with cases where we desire to calculate an expectation or approximate a probability distribution
given data, optimization considers cases where only a single output is desired.  For example, in
a decision problem only a single action can be taken, meaning a single optimal action must be
found.  It it is also often used in machine learning as a tractable alternative when full inference
is infeasible~\citep{murphy2012machine}.  In the next Chapter we discuss a method for introducing
optimization into the probabilistic programming framework.  Before doing this though, we provide
background on optimization in general and detail a particular approach called Bayesian
optimization~\cite{jones1998efficient,shahriari2016taking}.
