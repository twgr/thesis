\section{Thesis Aims and Layout}

This thesis contains a mixture of pedagogical material, literature review, and 
cutting-edge research.
Although there will inevitably be gaps, the aim is to take
the reader all the way from the fundamentals of probability and machine learning,
all the way through to highly advanced topics such as designing automatic
mixed inference-optimization engines for probabilistic programming languages,
such that the work is as self-contained as is realistically possible.  There are
three key rationales for doing this.  Firstly, it is done because our aim to make the work 
as accessible as possible and hopefully provide a useful guide to those new to the field.
Probabilistic programming, and machine learning more generally, draws
researchers from an exceptionally diverse pool of backgrounds; what is rudimentary
to, for example, the statistics community is often bewildering to the programming
languages community and vice-versa. Secondly, because probabilistic programing, and 
in particular the advanced content of this thesis, goes beyond conventional notions of
Bayesian modeling, 

Thirdly, we take a predominantly first principles approach because it is the authors' 
opinion that because machine learning moves so quickly, or perhaps simply because
of the nature of research itself, one tends to become so fixated on a small area of
research that the big picture becomes lost.  For good research it is important to not
only question ones contribution to a particular sub-field, but also the justification for
that subfield itself.  With the current hype surrounding machine learning and, in particular,
deep learning\footnote{Should be pronounced \emph{neu-ral net-works}}, returning to these
fundamental principles is more important than ever so that we know what the right approach
for a particular problem is.
