\chapter{Particle-Based Inference Methods}
\label{chp:part}

Particle-based inference methods (PBIM), such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)~\citep{gordon1993novel,doucet2001introduction} and 
particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods~\citep{andrieu2009pseudo,rainforth2016interacting},
are a powerful class of inference algorithms based on propagating populations of samples
known as \emph{particles}.  By working with populations of samples, also known as \emph{particle systems},
 at the same time, rather than individual
samples in turn, they allow information to be shared across the population and computational
resources to be adaptively reallocated to where they are needed.  A common feature of PBIMs is
that they make use \emph{intermediate information} available during the inference process and thereby
exploit the structure of the problem.  For example, SMC uses a series of intermediate target distributions
which act a stepping stones to the full posterior.  By using the information gathered from these intermediate
solutions, they can better allocate computational resources for the next target and combat the curse of
dimensionality.  As such, PBIMs can be highly effective for problems with rich, exploitable, structures, 
for example time series models, but are generally less effective for problems that do not lend themselves
to a series of intermediate targets.  For our purposes, an particularly important feature of particle based
methods is that they can be used for, and are often very effective at, conducting inference in PPS~\citep{wood2014new}, as we will
explain in the next chapter.
