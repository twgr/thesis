\chapter{Probabilistic Programming -- the User's Perspective}
\label{chp:probprog}

In this chapter, we will provide a high-level introduction to probabilistic programming,
outlining its aims and explaining how it can be used for and to extend Bayesian modeling.  The
key points we will convey are the ability of probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) to provide 
the \emph{flexibility} to define
wide ranging and potentially obscure models, the \emph{expressivity} of a framework for 
model definition that is more in line we conventional scientific simulation than mainstream 
statistical approaches, and the \emph{automation} to  run any problem the user might write
by decoupling model specification and inference.
Together these characteristics produce a framework that allows researchers whose expertise 
lies elsewhere, to carry out powerful statistical analyses for their application specific tasks.  
It also aids in the development of both inference
algorithms and models for those within the machine learning and statistics communities,
by removing many of the complications of one while developing the other.

We will for now focus on a user's perspective, introducing how and why one might want to use
probabilistic programming, explain how ideas from more mainstream Bayesian
modeling can be transferred, and demonstrate how probabilistic programming can be
used to both extend the traditional Bayesian framework and reinterpret many computational simulation
techniques not usually associated with Bayesian modeling in a more Bayesian mindset.
We will mostly ignore the rather major issue of how to conduct Bayesian inference for
models defined in probabilistic programs, assuming for now that we have a magical
general purpose inference engine that will solve any model we provide,
before returning to actually confront this major stumbling
block in Chapter~\ref{chp:proginf} once we have introduced the problems of Bayesian
inference more generally.  We will provide a brief introduction to the Anglican PPS
to give us a platform for providing examples and highlighting
key components of designing a PPS.  Finally, we discuss some of the current limitations
and opportunities for PPSs (other than the obvious computational
issues which we return to later), in particular demonstrating how we can use them to go beyond
standard inference frameworks and why we would want to do so.

\section{An Introduction to Anglican}
\label{sec:probprog:anglican}

One such general purpose system, \emph{Anglican}, will be used as a reference in this paper.  In Anglican, models are defined using the inference macro \defquery. These models, which we refer to as queries \citep{goodman_uai_2008}, specify a joint distribution $p(Y,X)$ over data $Y$ and variables $X$. Inference on the model is performed using the macro \doquery, which produces a sequence of approximate samples from the conditional distribution $p(X|Y)$ and, for importance sampling based inference algorithms (e.g. sequential Monte Carlo), a marginal likelihood estimate $p(Y)$.  

Random variables in an Anglican program are specified using \sample statements, which can be thought of as terms in the prior. Conditioning is specified using \observe statements which can be thought of as likelihood terms.  Outputs of the program, taking the form of posterior samples, are indicated by the return values.  There is a finite set of \sample and \observe statements in a program source code, but the number of times each statement is called can vary between executions.  We refer the reader to  \href{http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/}{\small\url{http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/}} for more details.
