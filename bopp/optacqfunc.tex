\subsection{Optimizing the Acquisition Function}
\label{sec:optacqfunc}

Optimizing the acquisition function for BOPP presents the issue that the query contains implicit constraints that are unknown to the surrogate function.  The problem of unknown constraints has been previously covered in the literature \citep{gardner2014bayesian,hernandez2015general} by assuming that constraints take the form of a black-box function which is modeled with a second surrogate function and must be evaluated in guess-and-check strategy to establish whether a point is valid. Along with the potentially significant expense such a method incurs, this approach is inappropriate for \emph{equality} constraints or when the target variables are potentially discrete.  For example, the Dirichlet distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:house-heating-code} introduces an equality constraint on \lsi{powers}, namely that its components must sum to $1$.

We therefore take an alternative approach based on directly using the program to optimize the acquisition function.  To do so we consider a transformed program \lsi{q-acq} that is identical to \lsi{q-prior} (see Section \ref{sec:domain}), but adds an additional \observe statement that assigns a weight $\zeta(\theta)$ to the execution.  By setting $\zeta(\theta)$ to the acquisition function, the maximum likelihood corresponds to the optimum of the acquisition function subject to the implicit program constraints.  %Critically, this evaluation does not require inference and so can be evaluated cheaply.
We obtain a maximum likelihood estimate for \lsi{q-acq} using a variant of annealed importance sampling \citep{neal2001annealed} in which lightweight Metropolis Hastings (LMH) \citep{wingate2011lightweight} with local random-walk moves is used as the base transition kernel. %The latter of these, which we refer to as random-walk Metropolis Hastings (RMH), is made possible by examining the type of the relevant distribution object at runtime to generate an appropriate local proposal kernel given the distribution type.

%Our final transformation generates a program, \qacq, which is identical to \qprior, except for adding an additional \observe statement that assigns a weight $\zeta(\theta)$ to the execution, where $\zeta$ is a function provided as an input.  By setting $\zeta(\theta)$ to the acquisition function and using a maximum likelihood algorithm to optimize the program, the optimum of the acquisition function subject to the implicit program constraints can be found as detailed in Section \ref{sec:optacqfunc}.
