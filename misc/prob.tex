\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{A Primer on Probability Theory}

This primer provides some essential background on probability theory and outlines conventions
that we will use throughout the thesis.  Readers familiar with the differences between a probability
and a probability density and between a random variable and an outcome may wish skip to this
section, referring back as needed for clarification on any conventions undertaken.  Others
will hopefully find it to be a gentle introduction to the key concepts that will be needed to
be understood to follow the rest of the thesis.  Notation has been chosen with accessibility 
as the primary aim and we will avoid
the use measure theory except were it is absolutely necessary.  Nonetheless, we note that a measure theoretic
approach to probability is essential for a more rigorous understanding and refer
the interested reader to~\cite{durrett2010probability}.

A \emph{random variable} is a variable
whose realization is currently unknown, such that it can take on multiple different
values or \emph{outcomes}.\footnote{Technically speaking, outcomes are points in \emph{sample
		space} and random variables are measurable functions from outcomes to a measurable
	space.  As we said though, we are trying to avoid the niceties of measure theory\dots}
A set of one of more outcomes is known as an \emph{event}.
For example, if we roll a fair six-sided dice then the result of the roll is a random variable, 
while rolling a $4$ both a possible outcome and a possible event.  Rolling a number greater
or equal to $5$ on the other hand, is a possible event but not a possible outcome: it is a set
of two individual outcomes, namely rolling a $5$ and rolling a $6$.  Outcomes are
\emph{mutually exclusive}, i.e. if its not possible for two separate outcomes to occur in a
particular trial, but events are not - for example it is possible for both the events that we
roll and even number and we roll a number greater than $3$ to occur.

A \emph{probability} is
the chance of an event occurring.  For example, if we denote the output
of our dice roll as $X$, then we can say that $P(X=4) = 1/6$ or that $P(X\le3) = 0.5$.  Here
$X=4$ and $X\le3$ are events for the random variable $X$ with probabilities of $1/6$ and $0.5$
respectively.   A probability of $0$ indicates that an event has no chance of happening, 
for example the probability that we role an $8$, while
a probability of $1$ indicates it is certain to happen, for example the probability 
that we role a number less than $7$.  All probabilities much thus lie (inclusively) between $0$ and $1$.  
We will regularly use the shorthand $P(x)$ to denote the probability of the event $P(X=x)$.  
We reiterate the importance distinction between the random variable $X$ and the outcome $x$:
the former has an unknown value (e.g. the result of the dice roll) and the latter is
a fixed possible realization of the random variable (e.g. rolling a $4$).
All the same, we will at times be intentionally carefree about delineating between
random variables and outcomes, except for when the distinction is explicitly necessary.

Somewhat surprisingly, there are two competing (and often incompatible)
formal definitions for what probabilities actually mean.  The frequentist definition of
probability is that it is the average proportion of the time an event will occur if the trial is 
repeated infinitely many times.  The Bayesian definition of probability is that it is the subjective
belief that an event will occur in the process of incomplete information.  Both viewpoints have
strengths and weaknesses and we will avoid being drawn into one of the biggest debates in
science, noting only that the philosophical differences between the two are typically completely
detached from the practical differences between the resulting
algorithms~\citep{steinhardt2012beyond}, despite the former all too often be used to argue
the superiority of one approach over another.

A \emph{conditional probability} is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.
For example, the conditional probability that we roll a $4$ with a dice given that we have rolled a $3$ or
higher is $P(X=4 | X\ge3) = 0.25$.  More typically, we will condition on events that are separate but
correlated to the event we care about.  For example, the probability of dying of lung cancer is higher
is you smoke.  The process of updating a probability using the information from another event is
known as conditioning on that event.  For example, one can condition the probability that a football team
will win the league this seasons on the results from their first few games.  

Though not technically axiomatic, the mathematical laws of probability can be summarized by the \emph{product rule}
and the \emph{sum rule}.  Remarkably, all of probability can be derived from these two simple rules.
The product rule states that the probability of two events occurring is the probability of one of the events
occurring times the probability of the over event happening given the first event happened, namely
\begin{align}
\label{eq:prob:prod}
P(A,B) := P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) =  P(B|A) P(A)
\end{align}
where we have introduced $P(A,B)$ as a shorthand for the probability that both the events $A$ and $B$ occur.
An immediate consequence of the product rule is Bayes' rule,
\begin{align}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)},
\end{align}
which we return at length in Section~\ref{sec:bayes:paradigm}.

The sum rule has a number of different representations, the most general of which is that 
the probability that either $A$ or $B$ occurs, $P(A\cup B)$, is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:prob:sum}
P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A, B).
\end{align}
The intuition of the sum rule is perhaps easiest to see by considering that
\[
P(B) - P(A \cap B) = P(B)(1-P(A|B)) = P(B, \neg A)
\]
 is the probability of $B$ and 
not $A$.  $P(A\cup B)$ can only occur if $A$ occurs or $B$ and not $A$ occurs.  As it is not
possible for both these events to occur, the probability of either event must be the sum of the
probability of each separate event.
There are a number of immediate consequences of the sum rule.  For example, if $A$ and $B$ are
mutually exclusive then $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.  As outcomes are mutually exclusive, it
follows from the sum rule and the axioms of probability that the sum of the probabilities
for each possible outcome is equal to $1$.  We can also use the sum rule to
define the concept of \emph{marginalizing} out a random variable $Y$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:prob:marginal}
P(X=x) = \sum_{i} P(X=x,Y=y_i)
\end{align}
where the sum is over all the possible outcomes of $Y$.  Here $P(X=x)$ is known as the
\emph{marginal probability} of $X$ and $P(X=x,Y=y)$ as the \emph{join probability} of $X$
and $Y$.

Conditional probabilities follow  the same key results as unconditional probabilities, but it 
should be noted that they do not define probability distributions over the conditioning term.  
For example, $P(A|B)$ is a probability distribution over $A$ with all the corresponding 
requirements, but is not a distribution over $B$.  Therefore,
for example, it is possible to have for example $\sum_{i} P(A|B=b_i) >1$.




Probability density

Cumulative probability

Change of variables

Expectation and variance



We will often implicitly use the notion of a density 
for both continuous and discrete random variables in the interest
convenience.  We will also be intentionally carefree about delineating between random
variables and the inputs to density functions, except for when the distinction is explicitly necessary.
