\section{Foundational Monte Carlo Inference Methods}
\label{sec:inf:foundation}

In this section we introduce the key inference methods that form
the basis upon which most Monte Carlo inference schemes are based.  The
key idea at the heart of all Monte Carlo inference methods is to use some form
of proposal distribution that we can easily sample from and then make
appropriate adjustments to achieve (typically approximate) samples from
the posterior.  All methods will require only an unnormalized distribution
\begin{align}
\label{eq:inf:unnorm-target}
\gamma(\theta) = \pi(\theta)Z
\end{align}
as a target where $Z = \int \gamma(\theta) d\theta$.  As such they will apply to
any situation where we desire to sample from an unnormalized 
(or in some cases normalized) distribution, for which
the Bayesian inference setting is a particular case where
$\gamma(\theta) = p(\mathcal{D}|\theta)p(\theta)$ and $Z = p(\mathcal{D})$.
They will, in general, vary only on how samples are proposal
and the subsequent adjustments that are made.  However, this will lead to a
plethora of different approaches, varying substantially in their motivation,
theoretical justification, algorithmic details, and the scenarios for which they
are effective.
