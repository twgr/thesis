\chapter{Automated Adaptive Design}
\label{chp:design}

From tuning microscopes to designing surveys on politics, all problems of 
experimental design can be reduced to the same mathematical abstraction:
choosing a design that maximizes the expected information gained from the 
experiment.
Bayesian experimental design (BED)~\citep{chaloner1995bayesian,sebastiani2000maximum} 
provides a powerful framework for this abstraction.  In BED
one constructs a likelihood model for the experiment outcome and then uses this, along
with a prior on the parameters one wishes to learn about, to find the experimental setup
that maximizes the expected information gathered by the experiment.  
If the model is correct, this forms a design strategy that is optimal from
an information-theoretic viewpoint \citep{sebastiani2000maximum}.  
The general nature of its formulation means that BED can, at least in principle, be applied
to almost any experimental design situation and it has been successfully used in a wide
array of fields such as psychology~\citep{myung2013tutorial,Cavagnaro:discounting,vincent2017darc},
Bayesian optimization~\citep{hennig2012entropy,hernandez2014predictive}, and
bioinformatics~\citep{vanlier2012bayesian}. \Bad can be particularly useful in \emph{sequential}
design settings, where it provides a means of constructing adaptive strategies that use
previous experience in order to make decisions which optimize the sequential learning process.

Unfortunately, as we alluded to in the previous chapter, BED problems, in
general,  require the calculation of a nested estimation.
In this chapter, we will provide a brief introduction to BED and show how our results
from the last chapter can be used to derive a new estimator for BED equations 
which has a better convergence rate for discrete output problems than the na\"{i}ve
estimator often used.  We will further introduce a novel framework for automating the
design of sequential experiments and demonstrate how this can be
effectively applied to automating psychological trials~\citep{vincent2017darc}.
