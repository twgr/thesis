\chapter{Probabilistic Machine Learning}
\label{chp:bayes}

In this chapter we will provide a high-level introduction to  some of the core approaches to
machine learning.  We will distinguish between discriminative and generative approaches,
outlining some of the key features that indicate when problems are more suited to one approach
or the other.  Our focus then switches to looking a probabilistic generative approaches that
will be the main focus of this thesis.  We will explain how the \emph{Bayesian paradigm} provides
a powerful framework for generative machine learning that allows us to combine data with existing
expertise.  We will then go on to show how \emph{graphical models} can be used as a convenient
framework to express Bayesian models and how they can be used to extract important features of the
model.  We continue by introducing one of the main competitors to the Bayesian approach -- frequentist
modeling -- and present arguments for why neither a Bayesian nor a frequentist approach is
entirely satisfactory.  In particular, we will carefully outline the, oft forgotten, fundamental underlying
assumptions made by each approach and demonstrate why the differing suitability of these assumptions
to different tasks shows why both approaches are essential tools in the arsenal of machine learning
methods, despite the fierce loyalty of many in the community to one approach or the other.
Though the focus of this thesis will be on Bayesian approaches, understanding its limitations
is essential for understanding when the methods we discuss should be used and critically when they
should definitely not be.  We finish the chapter by discussing some of the key practical challenges
for Bayesian modeling and how we will attempt to address a number of these with this work.
